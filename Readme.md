# Projects: `Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)`
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. It helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need, making it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions.

## `US Accident Exploratory Data Analysis`
In the context of the United States Accident Dataset, a comprehensive analysis and visualization were undertaken to extract significant insights from pivotal columns within the dataset. This analytical endeavor aimed to unravel valuable patterns and trends inherent in the data.

#### Summary and Conclusion
Insights:
- No data from New York
- The number of accidents per city decreases exponentially
- Less than 5% of cities have more than 1000 yearly accidents.
- Over 1200 cities have reported just one accident (need to investigate)

## `Car Exploratory Data Analysis`:
